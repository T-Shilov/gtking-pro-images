Hello,dear friends,

I am very interested in your project 'manjaro-arm'.
Images Manjaro-ARM-xfce-gtking-pro-20230904.img.xz  works great on GT-King :-)
I would like this amazing and useful project to continue to develop and improve successfully.
However, I didn't find an issue section for your project on github, and I don't know how to communicate my thoughts to you.
Please tell me how I can inform the developers of your project about the shortcomings of the project that I have noticed and my wishes?
Thank you!

Best regards
